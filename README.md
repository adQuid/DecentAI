# DecentAI
A basic framework for an AI for turn-based strategy games, along with an attached game or two for demonstration. Check out the [wiki](/wiki)

# Setup
DecentAI was built as an Eclipse project entirely with native libraries from Java 8. The project itself contains two main methods, each for a different demonstration game, but the project is intended to be imported as a jar file. At the time of writing I've done nothing to set it up for Maven or Gradle.
