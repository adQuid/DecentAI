# DecentAI
A basic framework for an AI for turn-based strategy games, along with an attached game or two for demonstration.

# Setup
DecentAI was built as an Eclipse project entirely with native libraries from Java 8. The project itself contains two main methods, each for a different demonstration game, but the project is intended to be imported as a jar file.
